## Objective of the Project
The objective of this project is to analyze the relationship between life expectancy and health expenditure across various countries. Using statistical tools and visualization techniques, the project explores patterns and trends to derive meaningful insights.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python**  
  - pandas  
  - numpy  
  - matplotlib  
  - seaborn  
  - scikit-learn  
- **Jupyter Notebook/VS Code** for development and execution.

## Data Source(s)
The dataset used in this project was obtained from **Kaggle**. It contains detailed information on health expenditure, life expectancy, and related socio-economic factors for multiple countries.

## Execution Steps (How to Run the Project)
1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**  
   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
3. **Set Up the Environment**  
   Install the required dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**  
   Navigate to the `src/` folder and open the `main.ipynb` notebook. Execute all cells to process the data and generate outputs.

5. **View Results**  
   - **Visualizations:** Check the `visuals/` folder for plots and graphs.  
   - **Final Output:** Review processed results in the `output/` folder.

## Summary of Results
- **Correlation Analysis:** Strong positive correlation between health expenditure and life expectancy in high-income countries.  
- **Outliers Identified:** Some countries exhibit higher life expectancy despite lower health expenditure.  
- **Visualization Highlights:** Trends vary significantly by region and income group.

## Challenges Faced
1. **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values and inconsistent data entries in the dataset.  
2. **Visualization Scaling:** Representing large datasets in a comprehensible manner.  
3. **Interpretation:** Identifying socio-economic factors influencing the observed trends.
